// control flow is working on intial run.
// when player loses correct play again messege shows.

// player doesn't bust if score goes over 21 and can still win if the computer hits lower than 21.

// game does not reset

// looks like you're appending the player's cards correctly but not clearing the player's card once the game is over.

// seems like you're keeping track of winning or loseing in multiple functions that don't work together.

/* Overall great start and use of Enums.
 A more solid understanding of the repeat while loops would helps with some of the bugs.
 Pay attention to Warnings, just becuase they might not crash the app, doesn't crash doesn't mean it will run correcty.
 I would suggest using breakpoints to see how the control flow is being handled.
